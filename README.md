# Image Magnifier WordPress plugin

A small plugin that adds ability to easily add zoomable images to posts. The frontend functionality is handled by [Magnify JS](https://thdoan.github.io/magnify).

To use, add the following shortcode to your post:

```
[magnify id="123"][/magnify]
```

The `id` attribute is the ID of the image attachment. 

The plugin also adds the shortcode to the Media Library screen as a inconvenience. Once you've selected an image, the shortcode can be found in the sidebar.
